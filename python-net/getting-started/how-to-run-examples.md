The complete project [GroupDocs.Metadata Examples](https://github.com/groupdocs-metadata/GroupDocs.Metadata-for-Python-via-.NET) with code examples and sample files is hosted at Github.

## Run examples using PyPI

To get started make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed.

1. Clone repository with GroupDocs.Metadata examples\
`git clone https://github.com/groupdocs-metadata/GroupDocs.Metadata-for-Python-via-.NET.git`
2. Navigate to the examples folder\
`cd ./GroupDocs.Metadata-for-Python-via-.NET/`
3. Install the necessary packages\
`pip install groupdocs-metadata-net`
4. Navigate to the examples folder\
`cd ./Examples`
5. Run the examples\
`python run_examples.py`

To check what examples are available open `Examples/run_examples.py` file using your favorite text editor.

By default the examples are shipped without a license file and works in evaluation mode.
To run the examples in full featured mode, please set a valid license file path in the file "./Examples/constants.py":
```python
license_path = "ะก:\resources\Licenses\GroupDocs.Metadata.lic"
```
In case you don't have a license yet, feel free to [**get a temp license**](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) to evaluate GroupDocs.Metadata in full featured mode.
